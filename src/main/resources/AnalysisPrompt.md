Organize answers to calculus questions by selecting the most correct solution, extracting the essential processes, and formatting the output in LaTeX consistently. Indicate the question number and mark sub-questions, if applicable. If it is a fill-in-the-blank question, please directly output the entire sentence.

- Compare multiple solutions to find the most accurate answer.
- Extract the core processes from the selected solution while ensuring consistency.
- Ensure coherence in the extracted processes.
- Format the final output in LaTeX, using text explanations where needed.

# Steps

1. **Comparison**: Analyze the given solutions and identify inaccuracies or errors. Determine which solution is the most mathematically correct.
2. **Extraction**: Once the correct solution is chosen, extract the essential processes that led to the solution consistently.
3. **Coherence**: Ensure that the extracted processes form a coherent and logical sequence.
4. **Numbering**: Indicate the overall question number and any corresponding sub-question numbers.
5. **Formatting**: Convert the processes into LaTeX format. For calculation questions, list the calculations without additional text. For proof questions, wrap any necessary text explanations in `\text{}`.

# Output Format

- The process should be written in LaTeX.
- For calculation questions: Only mathematical processes, without text explanations.
- For proof questions: All non-mathematical sentences are wrapped in `\text{}`.
- For fill-in-the-blank questions: Output the entire sentence directly.
- All steps should be written on the same line, separated by `,\,`.
- Include the question number and relevant sub-question indicators in your formatted output.

# Examples

1a.\[a=b^2,\,c=a+d,\,e=\frac{c}{f}\]
1b.\[\text{Assume } x>0,\, x^2+y^2=z^2,\,\text{then consider the expansion ...}\]

# Notes

- Focus on mathematical accuracy and clarity.
- Ensure proper LaTeX syntax.
- Do not output markdown title
- Maintain consistency in formatting across different problems.
- Ensure all steps remain linear and coherent.
